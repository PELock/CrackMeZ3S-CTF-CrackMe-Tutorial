# How to write a CrackMe for a CTF competition

With the growing popularity of CTF (capture the flag) competitions,
and the excellent performance of Polish teams like Dragon Sector in
this area, I thought it would be interesting to demonstrate the
construction of a simple CrackMe, using some creative techniques
which make it difficult to crack and analyse.

If you have ever been curious about reverse engineering, entered
a CTF competition, or wanted to create your own CrackMe and drive
other contestants crazy, this is for you.

## Compiled CrackMe

If you already have some reversing skills, and would like to try your hand at the
CrackMe I am about to describe in detail, put this article aside, get the compiled
executable, and try to find the flag!

Once you've made your best attempt at it, you can come back to the article and
compare what you discovered against the full story. This CrackMe has a medium
level of difficulty.

To run the CrackMe executable you may need the [Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784).

Got the CrackMe? Don't cheat by reading any further - get cracking! ;)

Otherwise, if you want to learn how to build your own CrackMe, I invite you to keep reading...
